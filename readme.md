### Home Page
The landing page offers two buttons.  The “Select Color” button directs user to the Select Color page.  The “Contact Us” button directs user to the contact form.  The user may select the button or the icon to go to their corresponding pages.

### Select Color Page
This page allows the user to select a color by either typing in a hex value or by using the red, green, and blue sliders together to select a color. All values on this page are defaulted to white until the user changes the values. The selected color is shown across the top part of the page. It changes dynamically with both input methods below and will always show the color selected by the user. Below that is the hex value input box. The user can tap on the value and type in a hex value of a color. That color will then show in the color box above. The sliders can also be used to select a color. When using the sliders, the hex value above will change with it, along with the color box. A third option to select a color is to click on the camera icon below the sliders, which will take you to the camera page, which will be detailed below. Once a color is input by the user, the submit button at the bottom of the page will lead to the results page.

### Results Page
After selecting a color, the user is taken to the results page. At the top of the page is the color the user selected along with the hex code. Below that is a list of complimentary colors and their respective hex values. Each complimentary color is calculated slightly different to give the user multiple options. For example, the first color is on the opposite side of the color wheel. This is calculated by taking the selected color’s red, blue, and green values and subtracting 255 from each, then converting that into a hex value to give the complementary color. The other complementaries are found by picking colors from different angles around the color wheel. At the bottom of this page is an export button. This will move the user to the export form.

### Export Form
This form is used to export the information from the results page to an email and send it to the user. The form will simply ask for the user’s email address. Once input, the user taps the submit button and an email will be sent to that address. The email will contain the information from the results page, which is the selected color along with all the complimentary colors and respective hex values.

### Contact Page
The user fills out information in the required fields of Name, Email, and Message.  Then the user submits message.  This message is picked up in our database for review and follow up.
